			<p class="par1">
	It all started one fateful Tuesday night in January 2006.  Ben walked in to audition for Danielle’s co-ed a cappella group at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.  And the rest, as they say, is history.  We started dating in January of 2007 and endured many periods of long-distance; from summers apart in Boston, New Orleans and Connecticut to a painful two-year distance (and many frequent flyer miles) between New York and Atlanta.  Eventually, we decided that if we were going to have a real future together, we’d need to live in the same state.  So in August of 2011, Danielle packed her bags and headed back down South to live happily alongside Ben in Atlanta.  While the move took careful consideration and planning, the proposal required a bit more man power to pull off…

	To say I was caught completely off guard by the proposal is a tremendous understatement.  It wasn’t that we hadn’t talked about getting married, but I definitely did not suspect to be proposed to on vacation.  Ben and I had planned a fabulous trip with two other couples from Vanderbilt to Puerto Vallerta, Mexico.  On Easter Sunday afternoon, Marie and Megan suggested a girl’s trip into town to go shopping and tour the city.  While the girls were out of the house, Ben, along with his trusty helpers, Andrew, Brian, and Meg’s family, went to work setting the stage for what promised to be a magical scene.  The girls returned to the house where Megan held the front door opened for me to enter first, saying “After you…”.  After being shoved inside, I turned around to see Megan and Marie smirking devilishly, whisper “Bye!” and scamper away as they closed the door in my face.

	When I turned back around to the inside of the house, I was stunned to see the amazing transformation in just a few hours’ time.  Strings of twinkling lights cascaded over the balcony and into the inner courtyard, which was scattered with candles and flowers.  In the middle of it all stood Ben, a sheepish grin on his face.  He took my hands and led me into the courtyard, where he proceeded to recount all the wonderful memories we’d shared over the years, leading us to this day.  He got down on his knee, presented me with the most beautiful ring, and asked if I’d continue to make more memories with him for the rest of our lives.  How could anyone say no to something like that?!  It’s been confirmed that I said an audible “Yes” through the tears and hugging, and we spent the rest of the night celebrating with our friends.

	The whole thing could not have been more perfect and we feel so blessed to start our married lives together on May 31, 2014.
